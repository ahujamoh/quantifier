This app is the code behind [beemind.me][1], a web app I made to automatically send data to [Beeminder][2].
If you are not familiar with Beeminder, it could be described as "goal tracking with teeth". The basic idea is they take your money if you don't meet the goals you have committed to.

They can automatically gather data from many 3rd party services that track excercise, sleep, productivity, and much more.
This app adds a few more integrations by allowing users to sign in with their Beeminder account to [beemind.me][1] and configure one of the supported integrations. See [beemind.me][1] fro more details.
